# TvStream

TvStream is a modern streaming web application built with a MERN-style stack and powered by Vite for a fast, optimized development experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React (with modern hooks and functional components)
- **Bundler / Dev Server**: Vite (for lightning-fast HMR and builds)
- **Language**: JavaScript / TypeScript (depending on project setup)
- **Styling**: CSS/SCSS (or your chosen UI library if configured)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (typical MERN backend, not included in this front-end template)
- **Database**: MongoDB (for user data, content metadata, etc., on the backend)
- **Linting / Quality**: ESLint (with recommended rules)

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Preview production build**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: React components, pages, hooks, and utilities
- **`public/`**: Static assets
- **`index.html`**: Vite entry HTML

You can extend this setup with your own Express/MongoDB backend to complete the full MERN stack for TvStream.
